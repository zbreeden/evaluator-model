# Evaluator Model

> **The Evaluator is the sucess metric**

## 🌌 Constellation Information

- **Module Key**: `evaluator_model`  
- **Repository**: `evaluator-model`
- **Orbit**: 📈
- **Status**: 🔥�
- **Emoji**: 🧠

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Review seeds/**: Adapt seeded data for this module
2. **Configure schemas/**: Update schema definitions as needed  
3. **Generate signals/**: Create latest.json broadcast file

## 📡 Broadcasting

This module produces a `signals/latest.json` file conforming to the constellation's broadcast schema. The Signal (📡) aggregates these across all stars.  Use new-broadcast.sh within /scripts to run a new broadast.

## 🔗 CORE SYSTEM Links

- **Hub**: [FourTwenty Analytics](https://github.com/zbreeden/FourTwentyAnalytics)
- **The Archive**: Glossary, tags, and canonical definitions pulled down nightly and distributed out for constellation harmony.
- **The Signal**: Cross-constellation broadcasting and telemetry pulled and circulated nightly to foster promotion and development.
- **The Launch**: Detailed workflows pulled in nightly to assure an aligned culture of process improvement that starts from the Barycenter outwards to foster healthy architecture.
- **The Protector**: Examines workflows to assure drift is minimal fostering sustainability.
- **The Develper**: Feeds the constellation data for healthy modelling.
